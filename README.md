# Smart-Trash

Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pictures of garbage bins being overfull and the garbage being spilled out from the bins can be seen all around. This leads to various diseases as large number of insects and mosquitoes breed on it. A big challenge in the urban cities is solid waste management. Hence, smart dustbin is a system which can eradicate this problem or at least reduce it to the minimum level.

This project IOT Garbage Monitoring system is a very innovative system which will help to keep the cities clean. This system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins via a Blynk based IOT Application. For this the system uses ultrasonic sensors placed over the bins to detect the garbage level and compare it with the garbage bins depth. The system makes use of Arduino microcontroller board, LCD screen, WIFI modem â€“ Node MCU for sending data and a buzzer. The LCD screen is used to display the status of the level of garbage collected in the bins. IoT Blynk Server is used to Monitor the Realtime status Level of the Bins. The system puts on the buzzer and Visual Red Led Indication, when the level of garbage collected crosses the set limit. This system is also equipped with Automatic Opening and Closing of Bin Door, if it detect any person standing near the bin to throw waste materials. Opening and Closing of the bins is done using Servo Motor and Ultrasonic Sensor. The power supply setup of the system contains a step-down transformer.

Proposed Work
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smart bins are an intelligent waste management system. They have wireless ultrasonic fill-level sensors embedded inside which detect how full the bin is and then, through the IoT, this data is sent to a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform. On the basis of this data, waste collection services can optimize their routes and frequency.
